<h3>Lucas Borrelli </h3>
<h4>Prior Work Experience and Strengths</h4>
<p>
My name is Lucas Borrelli and I have had past job experience working for Medfield Holdings LLC for the past four years doing landscaping. I would consider myself a fast learner which I believe can be important when it comes to starting a new job. I also would say that I work well with others which is a great skill to have no matter what the job presented is. I am also very good at following directions which is very important in any enviornment. Overall I would say my number one strength is that no matter what the task at hand is I always try my hardest no matter what the circumstance is.
